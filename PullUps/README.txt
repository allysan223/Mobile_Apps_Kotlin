Pull-Up Counter

This app count the number of pull ups using the phone's accelerometer.

The app is first starting by shaking the phone, then a dialog will pop up opting for which mode to start in.r

Free Mode: The counter runs and counts every pull up
Goal Mode: When selecting this mode the number of pull ups must also first be entered before starting the counter.
Then the counter is started and once the counter reaches the goal a sound will be played.

In both modes the user also able to press a button to pause and then shake the phone
again to resume.

This app assumes the phone is in the up-right position while in the users pocket while doing pull ups
and also the counter starts almost immediately after the mode is selected.
